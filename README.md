# ASL-Finger-Spelling-Recognition
Online recognition of American Sign Language Finger Spelling from a video (webcam) and interpretation of the gestures.

This project is a original work of Sameeran N Rao aka [snrao310] (https://github.com/snrao310).

All credits to him !

I am trying to further extend his project by implementing the GoogleNet model for ASL dataset in keras deep learning python library
and maybe other models too for a better performance comparison.
